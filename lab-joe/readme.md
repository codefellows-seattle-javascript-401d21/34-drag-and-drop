This Was a great lab for organizing the styling composition and maintainability of future projects. It was basically taking the cumulation of labs 31,32, and 33 and using a more efficient system for styling.

I created a _vars, _base, and _reset scss file that all import into the main.scss file in order to have a further separataion of concerns when it comes to organizing front end styling and its different parts. Great work.
